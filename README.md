Minesweeper
===========

A command line Ruby Minesweeper game, built to practice recursion.

## Cool Features
- Uses recursive function to calculate how many squares to expose depending on which one the player chooses
- Uses YAML to convert board states to text & save to `.ms` files
- Can load games from saved states

I built this while pair-programming with [Anthony Liang](http://github.com/liangtfm).
